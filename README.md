# Campus Bridge

Campus Bridge is a user-friendly web platform that brings together students from tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 colleges. It creates a space where students can connect, share knowledge, ideas, and experiences, regardless of their college or background. The platform offers roadmaps to help students achieve their goals, whether they are just starting or are at an advanced level.

Students can follow each other, and the system recommends connections based on their interests. There is a personal chat section for private and group conversations. A key feature is the post section, where students can share posts about events or achievements, motivating others and helping them develop their skills.

The query section allows students to ask questions, and the system provides relevant answers. Additionally, there is a public chat section where students can openly seek guidance by asking questions, and other students can respond based on their own experiences, adopting a collaborative learning environment.

Importantly, the platform also includes a resource section where students can access learning materials like books, roadmaps, and videos for different subjects and branches, selected to support their learning journey.
